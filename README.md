## Visualization 1
![This is an image](visualizations/movie_countries.svg)

###### The explanation of this visualization 
For this visualization, I select some of the countries and try to visualize the growth of a number of movies starting from 1980. My hypothesis was that the sum of movies of all western countries should take a higher percentage in the number of movies, and the visualizatin proves my point. 

## Visualization 2
