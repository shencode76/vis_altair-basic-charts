    "I want to use the second visualization to show the top 100 directors of the TV shows collected in Netflix movie library. I wonder which directors and which types of TV shows Netflix will include in its library. In this chart, we can clearly see that most directors only shoot TV shows for one season. Alastair Forthergill is the only director with three TV shows, Iginio, Stan, Shin, and Rob with two. There may be directors who produce best-selling TV shows, but for one reason or another don't put their name on them. It is not difficult to see from this dataset that movies occupy the majority of Netflix library, which also indicates that Alastair's TV show is very popular. He is known for Planet Earth (2006), The Blue Planet (2001) and Frozen Planet (2011).\n",
